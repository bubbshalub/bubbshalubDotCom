~vulbyte 2024/03~

## intro

in the year of our lord an savior 20xx it isn't uncommon for there to be remakes. infact a not insignifigant amount of games that are released are likely some remake or iterative game.

1. the last the cod games (remake of the original mw series)
1. cs2 (basically just a csgo reskin)
1. overwatch2
1. left4dead2
1. apex legends
1. pubG
1. & tf2

are all examples of games where if you were to look back on their originals, it would be hard to call the current version and the orginal the same game.

and all of these games are garbage compared to the quality and features of this videos subject

> mini montage of Mega Man powered up

## chapter 1 | what is a Mega Man?

Also known as Rockman in japan, Megaman is a sidescroller platformer shooter which originally game out [december 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man).
the game has you play as mega, taking on each level and it's subsiquent boss.

beating the boss will grant you it's power which you can then use for either locomotion or weaponization

the original game contained 6 "boss masters" with their unique levels.

<br/>

each stage has their own unique themes, gimmics, challanges, and approach.

<br/>

the main gimmic which made Megaman originally stand out was the fact that the power you took obtained after can then be taken and used against another boss in a rock, paper, sisors, dynamite, lazergun, deathray.

### the issues with the classic

the original game is plenty fun and i don't want it to seem like i'm hating on the orignal, but it's definantly has some rough edges. it is generally prettty solid with minimal complains, but it definantly more of a technical marvel then a graphical marvel.

and this gave some rather mixed results, some stages working well but others have issues like megaman blending in and the like.

with the prelim out of the way, we can talk about the subject at hand.
